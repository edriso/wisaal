# Image for the Tawasul Telegram bot. It runs from TypeScript source with tsx
# (no separate compile step), which keeps the setup simple.
#
# Migrations and seeding are NOT run here. Run them once per environment as
# setup steps (see docs/DEPLOY.md):
#     pnpm db:deploy && pnpm db:seed

# Install the pinned pnpm GLOBALLY rather than via corepack. The bot's CMD is
# `pnpm start`, so it invokes pnpm at container startup; with corepack, that
# triggers an interactive "download pnpm?" prompt for the runtime `node` user,
# which hangs a detached (`up -d`) container. A global pnpm needs no download.
RUN npm install -g pnpm@10.33.0

# Copy manifests first so `pnpm install` is cached when only source changes.

# The postinstall hook runs `prisma generate`, which needs the schema/config.

# Install ALL dependencies (the postinstall `prisma generate` and tsx need
# them). We set NODE_ENV to production AFTER this so the install does not skip
# anything.

# Regenerate the Prisma client against the final source tree. The install
# step above already generates it, but regenerating here makes the image
